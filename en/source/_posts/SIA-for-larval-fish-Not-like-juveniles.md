Stable isotopes analysis (SIA) for larval fish? Maybe NOT like juvenile fish!

## Citation ##

Weiping Mei, Yu Umezawa, Xin Wan, Jinghan Yuan, Chiyuki Sassa. (2018) Feeding habits estimated from weight-related isotope variations of mesopelagic fish larvae in the Kuroshio waters of the northeastern East China Sea. *ICES Journal of Marine Science*, fsy016, https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsy016

## Highlights ##

1\. The **nitrogen isotope** of fish **in the pre-flexion stage** could **NOT** be used for **trophic position analysis** because the maternal effect (i.e., the residual isotopes in larval fish from their parent fish individuals).

2\. The nitrogen isotope of fish **after flexion stage could be** appropriately used for trophic position analysis because the maternal effect was shown to disappear.

3\. The isotopes of fish in the larval stage changed with their body weight (or body size), and we hyphthesised that the trends （of isotopes vs body-weight or body-size, Figure S1）are different based on their different breeder types (income breeder and capital breeder) of their parent fish species.
